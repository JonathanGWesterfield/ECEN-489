# NewsBoi
Newsboi is both the mini project 1 and the final project.
By the time the course ended, I really stopped enjoying
android programming so I reused the Newsboi code since it 
is a pretty good app. The only thing that was added on to
it for the final project is storing the user location in 
firebase whenever an article is saved to remind them to 
read the article. I'm doing the bare minimum for the final
project since I dislike this so much.
